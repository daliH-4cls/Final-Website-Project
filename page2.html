    <h2>5.GOBB</h2>
    <img src="GameRank1.jpg">
    <p>Really low quality game. Only created to cash into the Poppy-Playtime craze. Extremely poorly
        optimized, but the quality that puts tripple A game to shame for not being worse
        is what makes this game somehow good. Both really unitentionallly and intentionally funny.</p>

    <h2>4.School Of Dragons</h2>
    <img src="*">
    <p>Doesn't exist anymore, but extremely nalstalgic and one of the few great online HTTYD mobile 
        games. But really cash grabby with dragons and quests, even tricking some kids into pay-to-play quests, 
        so it's only in 4th.</p>

    <h2>2. 99 Nights- Roblox</h2>
    <img src="GameRank2.jpg">
    <p>Very addictive, kind of trash, but extremely game-slop to the point that it's turned around 
        to be good. Mostly better to play with friends, but otherwise, it's still barable to play alone.</p>

    <p>Can write layer upon layers of analysis videos. Peam writing, peak characters, peak book based
        options, no slop. Just pure creative freedom used for the creators passion. Could on a rant but I am 
        not putting that much effort into this job that pays me in discord adminship.</p>
