    <h2>5.GOBB</h2>
    <img src="GameRank1.jpg">
    <p>Really low quality game. Only created to cash into the Poppy-Playtime craze. Extremely poorly
        optimized, but the quality that puts tripple A game to shame for not being worse
        is what makes this game somehow good. Both really unitentionallly and intentionally funny.</p>

    <h2>4.School Of Dragons</h2>
    <img src="GameRank4.jpg">
    <p>Doesn't exist anymore. Ancient artifact right here. Extremely nalstalgic and one of the few great online HTTYD mobile 
        games. But really cash grabby with dragons and quests, even tricking some kids into pay-to-play quests, 
        so it's only in 4th.</p>

    <h2>3. 99 Nights In The Forest</h2>
    <img src="GameRank2.jpg">
    <p>Very addictive, kind of trash, but extremely game-slop to the point that it's turned around 
        to be good. Mostly better to play with friends, but otherwise, it's still barable to play alone.</p>

    <h2>2. Dispatch</h2>
    <img src="GameRank5.jpg">
    <p>HR nightmare, but characters feel human and natural. Writing's sometimes off, or really questionable, which 
        drops it down to 2nd, but overall a great game.</p>

    <h2>1. Limbus Company</h2>
    <img src="GameRank3.jpg">
    <p>Can write layer upon layers of analysis videos. Peam writing, peak characters, peak book based
        options, no slop. Just pure creative freedom used for the creators passion. Could on a rant but I am 
        not putting that much effort into this job that pays me in discord adminship.</p>
