    <h2>5. Cyberpunk 2077</h2>

    <p>Released incredibly broken. Had hundreds of delays, indicating that higher ups kept on pushing
        unrealistic expectations onto the developers. And 100% non-play tested during development.

    <p>Absolute Cinema. And absolute dumpster fire. Just as said in the "best Ranking" article, what makes it so good is 
        also what makes it awful. From poor optimization to just the games existence. But it's still not as bad as #1.</p>

    <h2>1. The Sims 4</h2>
    <img src="GameRank6.jpg">
    <p>Game so awful its image doesn't deserve to not be scruntched. Any expectations for a game
        by EA to be good is equevilant to believing demons in the anime, Freiren, can be good. The only tripple A 
        game that has competed and won against GOBB.</p>
